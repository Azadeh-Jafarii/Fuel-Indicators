On Page 1 of the Full Indicators.pbix report, there is a horizontal slicer in the center that allows users to select different indicators (such as Available Gasoil, Consumed Gas, etc.).
Based on the selected indicator, the column chart displays the corresponding values for each power plant, while the pie chart shows the distribution of values across different regions.

On Page 2, users can select one of the two buttons on the left side to view either the trend of the selected indicator over time in a line chart (with drill-down options by year, month, day, and hour)
or to see its monthly values grouped by year.
